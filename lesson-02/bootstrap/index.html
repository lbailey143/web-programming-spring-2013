  <h4>The Back Story</h4>
  <p>Greetings! I am a retired high school administrator living over on the coast in Gualala.</p>
  <p>Back in the day -- mid to late 1990s -- I followed the development of the WWW on the listservs and enjoyed reading the discussions of Andreesen, Berners Lee, Bina, and others as new ideas entered the picture. It was a fecund time with new ideas flashing by just about as fast as they do today.</p>
  <p>I also started teaching classes for teachers after school, on Saturdays, and in the summer to introduce them to email, web browsing, ftp, and basic html. I wrote and administered the school's web page, way back when we were just beginning to hear about background colors, background images, inline images, and font treatments. I remember when the heavy hitters on the listserv began firing off posts about something new called &quot;java&quot;. Ah the good old days.</p>
    <p>Fast forward to about 2006. I had gotten way too involved in other aspects of school administration and my primitive webmaster skills were not being used. I bought a simple WYSIWYG program from Serif, called &quot;Webplus&quot; and wrote a webpage for my wife's art work, then another for my own amateur photography. When I moved to Gualala, I helped the local bookstore put up a new site using a Drupal template modified by the American Booksellers Association, so I got to see how e-commerce works without having to learn to code it myself. I also put up a few simple sites for other artist friends and for the local fitness center.</p>
    <p>Then comes Santa Rosa Junior College. A friend was taking some online courses and mentioned it. I was intrigued and signed up for Photoshop I and have been taking online courses every since.  This spring will complete my second full year.<!-- end .content --></p>
